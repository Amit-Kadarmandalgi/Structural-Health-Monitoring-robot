# Structural-Health-Monitoring-robot
Building a robot to monitoring faults in railway tracks with the help of Infra Red sensor and image processing.
IR sensor acts as a filter as it detects crack as a non reflecting surface and image processing would confirm it. If 
a crack is detected the bot must wirelessly transfer data to concerned authority by sending sms to respective 
authority using GSM module. It will also map the location points of the crack detected using GPS module. 
This is mainly a real time working prototype which will be employed to carry out research experiments in hence 
the project will be divided into hardware and software parts. The software parts focus on objectives such as 
improving image processing algorithms for crack detection along with Embedded C coding to interface sensors 
and modules on Arduino. The Hardware Part mainly focuses on making the prototype more efficient in real 
time environments which include sensor interfacing using Arduino and controlling its movement
